* Doom configuration for David Janssen

** Structure

This repo contains the contents of the `~/.config/doom` directory. A quick guide
to the files:
- packages.el: Currently empty, could be used install further packages.
- init.el: Collection of enabled doom modules
- config.el: Entry-point of my own config
- my/theme.el: Autogenerated by home-manager, instructs which theme to use
- my/*.el: Modularized configuration

The methods used herein are in no way guaranteed to be optimal, or even good,
but they're the best that I've managed, and you may find some inspiration in
them also.
